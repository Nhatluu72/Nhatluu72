- **Frameworks**: React, Node.js, Django
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Docker
- **Interests**: I'm particularly keen on exploring DevOps practices to streamline software deployment and ensure smooth workflows.

⚡ **Fun Facts:**
- When I’m not coding, I love playing soccer or sparring in boxing to keep active and energized.
I’m also a huge fan of soccer. Cristiano Ronaldo is my all-time favorite player and also my biggest inspiration!
- Music, games, and movies help me unwind after a day of coding, and I’m always looking for new songs or films to explore.

📈 **Future Goals:**  
- Develop and launch a production-ready software project that solves real-world problems.
- Continue learning advanced software development techniques, especially in AI-powered applications and cloud computing.
- Complete my degree in Computer Science and get enrolled in my dream university, where I can work on cutting-edge software projects.
